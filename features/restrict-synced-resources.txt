Restricting the kinds of resources that can be synced

As an admin of the gitops registration service, 
I want to be able to provide either:
* resources allowList or
* resources denyList

as part of the gitops registration service config. Based on those parameters, when a new AppProject is created, the gitops registration service will configure new appProjects using the built-in whitelist / blacklist feature.

GitOps registration Serice should only accept either an allowList or a denyList, but not both.

If an allowList is provided, only the resources in the allowList will be synced.

If a denyList is provided, all resources except the ones in the denyList will be synced.

If no allowList or denyList is provided, all resources will be synced.

The allowList and denyList should be a list of resource types. Some of the resource types will be CRDs, so don't try to validate that the resourceTypes are valid.

An example of configuring an appProject blacklist:

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: control-plane-only
spec:
  clusterResourceBlacklist:
    - group: kafka.strimzi.io
      kind: KafkaTopic
    - group: mycompany.io
      kind: RedisCluster
    - group: database.example.com
      kind: MySQLDatabase

An example with a whitelist:

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: control-plane-only
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  description: >
    Only allows control-plane resources. Everything else is blocked by default.
    
  # Allow only specific cluster-scoped resource kinds
  clusterResourceWhitelist:
    - group: ""
      kind: ConfigMap
    - group: ""
      kind: Service
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
    - group: apiextensions.k8s.io
      kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    - group: controlplane.mycompany.io
      kind: ControlPlaneComponent

  # Allow only specific namespaced resource kinds
  namespaceResourceWhitelist:
    - group: ""
      kind: ConfigMap
    - group: ""
      kind: Service
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
    - group: controlplane.mycompany.io
      kind: ControlPlaneComponent

  # Optional: limit the destinations too
  destinations:
    - namespace: "*"
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc

  # Optional: limit to certain source repos
  sourceRepos:
    - https://github.com/mycompany/control-plane-gitops


Our app projects should already use "destinations" to enforce that an AppProject can only sync to a specific namespace. Ensure there is a unit test for that.

Then crete this feature, and ensure there is good unit test coverage ensuring the argocd AppProject is generated correctly. 

Finally, add integration tests that check that 
* a real repo cannot sync a resource type on a blacklist
* a real repo cannot sync a resource type missing from a whitelist
* syncing from a real repo which does not violate either of these conditions still works properly.
